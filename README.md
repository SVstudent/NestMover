## 🚀 The Problem

**Moving to a new city is one of life's most stressful experiences.** You don't know where the best grocery stores are, which gym fits your routine, what restaurants match your taste, or whether a neighborhood truly aligns with your lifestyle. Most people spend *weeks* of trial-and-error before they feel settled — searching through generic review sites that know nothing about *them*.

There is no existing tool that takes your *personal history and preferences* and proactively recommends places tailored to your unique lifestyle in a new city.

## 💡 The Solution

**NestMover** is an AI-powered relocation assistant that eliminates the guesswork of moving. It analyzes your **Google Maps search history** using **Gemini 3** to deeply understand your lifestyle — your preferred cuisines, activity patterns, commute habits, budget range, and environment preferences — then generates **hyper-personalized place recommendations** in your new city.

Instead of browsing hundreds of generic results, you get a curated feed of places that *feel like you*, complete with confidence scores, personalized explanations, distance calculations, and Google Maps links.

## 🤖 How Gemini 3 Powers NestMover

NestMover leverages **Google's Gemini 3** as its core intelligence engine across two critical pipelines:

### Pipeline 1: Behavioral Profile Generation
When a user uploads their Google Maps search history (exported via Google Takeout), Gemini 3 acts as a **data scientist** to:

1. **Parse & analyze** thousands of search entries from the JSON data
2. **Identify patterns** — frequent locations, preferred business types, time-of-day habits
3. **Infer lifestyle preferences** — cost sensitivity, environment preferences (e.g., "cozy", "trendy", "family-friendly"), and social priorities (e.g., accessibility, safety, pet-friendliness)
4. **Generate structured profiles** — outputting validated JSON with transportation modes, interest categories (with subcategories), environment descriptors, cost preferences, and confidence scores

The system instruction is carefully engineered to produce structured, parseable JSON with detailed fields like `userPreferences` (first-person narratives), `environmentDescriptors` (up to 6 adjectives), `relatedSubcategories`, and `costPreference`.

### Pipeline 2: Personalized Place Recommendations
When a user explores a category, Gemini 3 receives:
- The user's full profile (age, gender, address, transportation preferences, lifestyle narrative)
- Category-specific context (subcategories, environment descriptors, cost range)
- A directive to recommend real places with explanations

Gemini 3 returns structured recommendations with `place`, `address`, `personalizedSummary`, `recommendationReasoning`, and `confidence` scores — all rendered as interactive cards with live Google Maps data.

### Why Gemini 3?
- **Multimodal understanding**: Gemini 3 processes large, unstructured JSON data exports and extracts nuanced behavioral patterns that simpler models miss
- **Structured output generation**: Gemini 3 reliably produces complex, nested JSON schemas for downstream processing — critical for our multi-step profiling pipeline
- **Contextual reasoning**: Gemini 3 generates human-readable explanations of *why* a specific place matches a specific user, enabling true AI transparency
- **Speed & efficiency**: Gemini 3's optimized inference enables real-time recommendation generation with sub-second response times, making the explore experience feel instant

## 🌍 Real-World Impact

### Who This Helps
- **40+ million Americans move each year** — NestMover directly addresses the discovery problem every mover faces
- **College students** relocating for school who need to quickly find essentials in an unfamiliar city
- **Remote workers** exploring new cities to live in and wanting AI-powered local insights
- **International movers** with no local knowledge and a strong need for personalized guidance
- **Families** needing to find family-friendly restaurants, parks, and schools that match their specific priorities

### Why It Matters
Existing solutions (Google Maps, Yelp, Reddit) require users to *already know what they're looking for*. NestMover flips this model by proactively understanding the user through their behavioral history and intelligently surfacing relevant places — turning a weeks-long discovery process into minutes.
